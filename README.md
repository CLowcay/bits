# Bitwise benchmarks

Benchmarking some of the bit tricks from https://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html .

These benchmarks are intended to compare the relative costs of different implemenations of the same operation.  As such, the results from interleave.c and reverse.c cannot be meaningfully compared with each other.

Feel free to post an issue or pull request if you have any suggestions or improvements.
